# Estimation Panel for Jira

A simple Estimation Panel for Jira, ideal for offline estimates as an alternative to Poker Planning.

Estimation Panel offers a simple alternative to Planning Poker. Teams can put estimates directly on the issue side panel, with support for customizable scales like Fibonacci, T-shirt sizes, etc., and with no need to set up planning sessions.

​The Estimation Panel for Jira is a simple and flexible tool for teams to estimate directly on Jira issues, supporting quick and collaborative planning. It’s the absolute minimum any Agile team needs for estimation and planning. Use one of the predefined scales to set estimates in story points, days, or hours - or go with your own custom scale to match your team’s style. Built on the Atlassian Forge platform for a secure, Jira-native experience with data that never leaves your Jira. 

Perfect for Agile teams looking to streamline their process without added overhead.
