    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect the Plugin and any data processed within Jira. However, we do not control Jira’s security and cannot guarantee the security of information stored or processed within Jira.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Plugin does not share information with any third-party services. Atlassian Marketplace’s terms may also apply to your use of the Plugin.</p>
