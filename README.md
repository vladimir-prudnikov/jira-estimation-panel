# Estimation Panel for Jira

A simple Estimation Panel for Jira, ideal for offline estimates as an alternative to Poker Planning.

Estimation Panel offers a simple alternative to Planning Poker. Teams can put estimates directly on the issue side panel, with support for customizable scales like Fibonacci, T-shirt sizes, etc., and with no need to set up planning sessions.

## Teams put estimates directly on the issue side panel
Teams can estimate using customizable scales like Fibonacci and T-shirt sizes. See whoâ€™s voted and whose estimates are pending, enhancing visibility during estimation.
